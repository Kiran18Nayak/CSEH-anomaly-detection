This was my online internship project with innovate after my fourth sem.
The tool is developed using reactjs to detect anomaly in any .pcapng wireshark file. 
In my tool, I have defined the anomaly as a sudden rise or sudden fall in packet count. 
The tool takes wireshark file as input and provide alert if the anomaly is present in file, else returns message no error detected.
The online platform 'sandbox' is being used for my tool the dependency required were very basic in it. 
I also have tested the program with two .pcapng files, one has anomaly(the sudden rise in packet count) and other doesnot. The file that has anomaly is synthetic_anomaly.pcapng and the normal file is pack(net log).pcapng.
The file named app.js is the tool program which is used to detect the anomaly.

Thank you
